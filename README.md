# RPLH: A Light-Weight Agent-Based Multi-Collaboration System
We hope to build an system that is lightweight, customizable, and that is caplable of social-reasoning and expecting what the other agent should be doing through the lens of advesarial collaboration. We are building a generalize agent model for every single agent in this environment and hopefully moving a step closer to level-one agent.
